Football Player Tagger by Joe Kampschmidt

An experiment in learning AngularJS. Created from the angular-seed.

The UI allows for the adding of players, tags and the ability to tag players. The idea being of having a database of players with descriptive tags.

The end goal would be to display example queries like the following:

- all players who are enforcers
- brilliant and frustrating players
